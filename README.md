Project using SQLite and NetBeans
=================================

This project was to test my knowledge and to use the SQLite library. To run this code you will need NetBeans IDE
installed on your machine. 


When you open up the project you will also need to add the two jar files. To add the
jar files you will need to first right click on the project and click properties. On the widnow that opens,
choose libraries and then click add jar/folder. Then select the jar file and press open. You will have to
add the other jar file once you added one of them. After that you should be able to run the project.
